# Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of various machine learning models for classification tasks, including:
•	Logistic Regression with L1 and L2 Regularization
•	Ridge Regression for linear modeling
•	Neural Network with Dropout to prevent overfitting
Additionally, visualization of coefficient values for L1 and L2 regularization and model performance is included.

 # Models Implemented
1️.Logistic Regression
•	L1 Regularization (penalty='l1') with liblinear and saga solvers
•	L2 Regularization (penalty='l2') with lbfgs solver
•	Model Accuracy Comparison of L1 and L2 Regularization
•	Visualizing Coefficients for Regularized Models
2️. Ridge Regression
•	Ridge Regression Model (alpha=1.0)
3️. Neural Network with Dropout
•	Input Layer with 128 neurons, ReLU activation
•	Dropout (0.5) to prevent overfitting
•	Hidden Layer with 64 neurons, ReLU activation, Dropout (0.3)
•	Output Layer with Sigmoid activation for binary classification
•	Model compiled with adam optimizer and binary_crossentropy loss

#  Model Performance Summary
•	L1 Logistic Regression Accuracy: ~84.00%
•	L2 Logistic Regression Accuracy: ~83.67%
•	Dropout Neural Network Accuracy: ~90.33%

#  Visualization
•	Coefficient comparison for L1 and L2 Regularization
•	Training and Validation Accuracy of Dropout Neural Network over epochs

#  Instructions for Modification
•	Update X_train and y_train with real-world datasets.
•	Modify hyperparameters in LogisticRegression or Sequential models if needed.
•	Tune dropout rates or increase epochs for better neural network performance.

#  Troubleshooting
•	If visualizations are not displayed in GitHub, use nbviewer to view rendered notebooks.
•	Make sure to restart the Jupyter kernel after installing new dependencies.
